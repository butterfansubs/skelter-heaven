For the sake of finding the dream that is gone
	Mienai chikara ni ima michibikareru mama
A power you can't see is guiding us
	Haruka tooku no GOAL mezashite
and we aim for a far away goal

Where should we go in this town we have not seen? 
	Takanaru mune mayowazu hashiri tsuzuketai (ah-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a)
Our beating chest won't be lost, it'll keep running! 

	Inochi wo kakete idomu I can fly kowai mono nante nai
We challange you with our lives on the line. 
I CAN FLY
There are no scary things at all.
	Hadaka no kokoro to kokoro de tsunagatteitai yo
The heart of nakedness and heart are trying to connect! 
	Kibou no hikari kanji in the sky dare yori mo takaku tobe
Light of hope! 
Kanji in the sky! 
Flying higher than anyone can get to.
	Me no mae no unmei kirihirake owaru koto nai mirai e
Before our eyes opens a fate
to a future without an ending.

Take to the sky
