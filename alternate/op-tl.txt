	Tozasareteku taiyou sagashi ni tabidatou
We are on a journey to find a sun that went dark

	Nakushita yume wo torimodosu tame
For the sake of finding the lost dreams
	Mienai chikara ni ima michibikareru mama
An in-visible power guides us
	Haruka tooku no GOAL mezashite
and we aim for a faraway goal

	Mishiranu machi bokura ha doko he ikeba ii n darou
Where should we go in this town that's unfamiliar? 
	Takanaru mune mayowazu hashiri tsudzuketai (ah-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a)
Our pounding chest won't lose, it'll keep running! 

	Inochi wo kakete idomu I can fly kowai mono nante nai
We risk our lives to challenge you
I CAN FLY
There is nothing that scares me.
	Hadaka no kokoro to kokoro de tsunagatteitai yo
The naked heart-to-heart is trying to connect! 
	Kibou no hikari kanji in the sky dare yori mo takaku tobe
Light of hope! 
Kanji in the sky! 
Flying to where no-one has ever flown before.
	Me no mae no unmei kirihirake owaru koto nai mirai he
Our eyes behold a fate that opens
to a truly endless future.

Up to the sky
