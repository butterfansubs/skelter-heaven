	Ayatsurareteku unmei ga kanashimi no soko de kamawanai
The controlling hand of destiny
does not care about the depths of despair.
	Tsunagareta ito anata he to tsudzuku karami hodoite suki ni shite yo
The fate thread connected to you, is un-ravelling
Now Do whatever you want
	Heart ugokasareteru hodo itami hashiru no
Heart starts to run because, of all my pain
	Endless me sameru omoi ni kokyuu sae dekinai
Endless thoughts keep me awake, I can't even breath
	Anata wo mamoreru nara karada kuchihatete mo ii
If I protect you then I dont care, what happens to my body
	Ai no akashi wo daita watashi wo mitete
My love's embrace has been proven. Witness me
	Mune ni te wo oshitsukete eien sagashiteru no
Force you're hand onto my chest
And never look away
	Itsumo hitori ni shinaide
You're not alone, not this time
	Watashi no subete ha sou anata kara hajimaru
My everything, this is how it begins
It all starts with you
