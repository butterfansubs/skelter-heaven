	Ayatsurareteku unmei ga kanashimi no soko de kamawanai
The fate that is controlled 
does not care about the sadness at the bottom.
	Tsunagareta ito anata he to tsudzuku karami hodoite suki ni shite yo
The thread the is connected with you is coming undone
Do what you want
	Heart ugokasareteru hodo itami hashiru no
The pain is running to the point of making my heart move
	Endless me sameru omoi ni kokyuu sae dekinai
Endless thoughts are coming awake without even being able to breathe
	Anata wo mamoreru nara karada kuchihatete mo ii
If I can protect you then my body can fall into obscurity, that's okay, too.
	Ai no akashi wo daita watashi wo mitete
Watch me who has embraced the proof of love.
	Mune ni te wo oshitsukete eien sagashiteru no
Impose yourself with your hand on my breast
And look for eternity
	Itsumo hitori ni shinaide
Don't do this alone as always
	Watashi no subete ha sou anata kara hajimaru
My everything starts from your like this.
