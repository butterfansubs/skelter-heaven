	Ayatsurareteku unmei ga kanashimi no soko de kamawanai
I leave my life up to fate
What can I do?
Perhaps I live in deep despair, I don't really care
	Tsunagareta ito anata e to tsuzuku karami hodoite suki ni shite yo
Here we are, it's me and you
We're tied by our two destinies
But I know it might not be what you wish for in your

	Heart ugokasareteru hodo itami hashiru no
Heart...
The pain inside me grows much too strong
It makes me get up and fight
	Endless mezameru omoi ni kokyuu sae dekinai
Endless...
These feelings well up in my heart
I am crushed under all my feelings

	Anata wo mamoreru nara karada kuchihatete mo ii
What can I do to protect you? I cried
I'd let myself break completely for you
	Ai no akashi wo daita watashi wo mitete
I have embraced all the love that's inside
Hey, why don't you look my way?
	Mune ni te wo oshitsukete eien sagashiteru no
Now lay your hand on this heart of my own
Let's look for time everlasting, endless
	Itsumo hitori ni shinaide
I'm begging you please, don't you leave me alone
	Watashi no subete wa sou anata kara hajimaru
Life after won't mean a thing, don't you know?
All that I am is because of you
