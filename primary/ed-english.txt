I leave my life up to fate / What can I do? / Perhaps I live in deep despair, I don't really care
Here we are, it's me and you / We're tied by our two destinies / But I know it might not be what you wish for in your

Heart... The pain inside me grows much too strong / It makes me get up and fight
Endless... These feelings well up in my heart / I am crushed under all my feelings

What can I do to protect you? I cried / I'd let myself break completely for you
I have embraced all the love that's inside / Hey, why don't you look my way?
Now lay your hand on this heart of my own / Let's look for time everlasting, endless
I'm begging you please, don't you leave me alone
Life after won't mean a thing, don't you know? / All that I am is because of you
