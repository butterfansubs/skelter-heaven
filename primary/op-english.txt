You'll |al|ways |find |us |cha|sing |in |pur|suit |of |a |sun |that's |hi|ding |a|way

'Cause |there's |a |dream |that |we |have |lost |and |want |to |find |a|gain

There |is |a |hid|den |po|wer |deep |in|side |and |it's |al|ways |gui|ding |our |way

Out |in |the |dis|tance, |our |goal |is |there |to |a|ttain

In |a |town |that |none |of |us |real|ly |know,
Where |there's |no |one |to |show |us |which |way |we |should |go,
Know |our |hearts |will |ne|ver |lead |us |as|tray
From |the |path |that |we |should |ta||-a||-a||-a||-ake!

Life |on |the |line, |I |will |spread |my |wings |so |I |can |fly!
'Cause |why |would |I |have |a|ny|thing |to |fear?
With |my |soul |bared |to |your |soul |and |your |soul |to |mine,
I |want |to |fly |out |there |with |you
En|ter |the |light! |We |can |fly |high |up |in |the |sky
With |wings |of |hope, |we're |rea|ching |new |fron|tiers
And |now |here |right |in |front |of |our |eyes |stre|ching |out |to |the |skies, |here |our |des|ti|ny |lies |for |us |to |claim

Take |to |the |sky!
