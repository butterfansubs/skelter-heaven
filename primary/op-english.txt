You'll always find us chasing in pursuit of a sun that's hiding away
'Cause there's a dream that we have lost and want to find again
There is a hidden power deep inside and it's always guiding our way
Out in the distance, our goal is there to attain

In a town that none of us really know, where there's no one to show us which way we should go,
Know our hearts will never lead us astray from the path that we should ta-a-ake!

Life on the line, I will spread my wings so I can fly! 'Cause why would I have anything to fear?
With my soul bared to your soul and your soul to mine, I want to fly out there with you
Enter the light! We can fly high up in the sky. With wings of hope, we're reaching new frontiers
And now here right in front of our eyes streching out to the skies, here our destiny lies for us to claim

Take to the sky!
